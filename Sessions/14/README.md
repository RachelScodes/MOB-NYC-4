# GA MOB 4 - Lesson Plan 14 - Intro to Auto Layout


## Learning Objectives

* Distinguish between Springs-and-Struts and Auto Layout.
* Define what a "constraint" is and how we apply them to views.
* Devise layouts using Auto Layout and Interface Builder.
* Distinguish the differences between frame and constraint bounds.

## Topics

* Review of Views and terminology
    * Views are drawable
    * Rectangular areas
    * That have the potential for interactivity
    * frame = position + size
* Review of Springs and Struts
* What problems does Auto Layout solve?
* Making Auto Layout constraints
    * Making constraints in IB to the container
        * Centering vertically and horizontally
        * Leading, trailing, top, bottom edges
        * Proportional constraints
        * Edges to centers
    * Constraints to siblings
        * Vertical and horizontal spacing
    * Self-referential constraints
        * Width and height
    * Auto Layout adjusts constraints live
        * as views change size
        * as orientation changes
