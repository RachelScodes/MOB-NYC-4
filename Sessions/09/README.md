# GA MOB 4 - Lesson Plan 09 - Data Structures

## Lesson Objectives

* Compare and contrast tuples, arrays, and dictionaries.
* Create, modify, and iterate over arrays.
* Identify and use array methods and properties.
* Create, modify, and iterate over dictionaries.
* Identify and use dictionary methods and properties.
* Create and deploy tuples.
* Use tuples as return values.
* Closures through maps and filters.


## Prerequisites

**We Heart Swift** - Chapters 6, 10, 11

## Topics

* Arrays
    * methods and properties
    * map
    * filter
* Dictionaries
    * declaring the type
    * setting values by key
    * methods and properties
* Tuples
    * Convenient way to bundle values together
    * The type of the tuple is the ordered collection of types it contains. Must be consistent.
    * Can have names, just like function parameters.
